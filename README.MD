# TrendFollow Strategy

This is a simple trend-following strategy implemented in Python using the Freqtrade framework. The strategy is designed to work on a 5-minute timeframe and aims to capture short-term price trends in the market.

## Installation

1. First, ensure you have [Freqtrade](https://www.freqtrade.io/) installed and set up.
2. Copy the `TrendFollowStr.py` file into the `user_data/strategies` directory of your Freqtrade installation.
3. Use prepared conf.file

## Strategy Overview

The TrendFollowStr strategy uses the following indicators:

- **On-Balance Volume (OBV):** OBV is a cumulative indicator that measures buying and selling pressure based on trading volume.
- **Exponential Moving Average (EMA):** A 20-period EMA is used as a trend indicator.

## Strategy Parameters

- **minimal_roi:** A dictionary representing the minimum return on investment required for the strategy to exit a position.
- **stoploss:** The stop-loss value for the strategy. If the position reaches this level, it will be closed to limit losses.
- **trailing_stop:** If set to `True`, a trailing stop will be used to protect profits and limit losses.
- **trailing_stop_positive:** The percentage at which the trailing stop will be triggered to protect profits.
- **trailing_stop_positive_offset:** An offset added to the trailing stop to reduce the risk of premature triggering.
- **trailing_only_offset_is_reached:** If set to `True`, the trailing stop will be used only after the positive offset is reached.

## Indicator Calculation

The strategy uses the `populate_indicators` method to calculate the following indicators:

1. **OBV (On-Balance Volume):** Calculated using the `ta.OBV` function from the `talib` library.
2. **EMA (Exponential Moving Average):** A 20-period EMA of the closing prices.

## Entry Rules

The strategy determines the entry points using the `populate_entry_trend` method with the following conditions:

- Enter Long:
  - The current closing price is above the EMA.
  - The previous closing price was below the previous EMA.
  - The current OBV is higher than the previous OBV.

- Enter Short:
  - The current closing price is below the EMA.
  - The previous closing price was above the previous EMA.
  - The current OBV is lower than the previous OBV.

## Exit Rules

The strategy determines the exit points using the `populate_exit_trend` method with the following conditions:

- Exit Long:
  - The current closing price is below the EMA.
  - The previous closing price was above the previous EMA.
  - The current OBV is higher than the previous OBV.

- Exit Short:
  - The current closing price is above the EMA.
  - The previous closing price was below the previous EMA.
  - The current OBV is lower than the previous OBV.
